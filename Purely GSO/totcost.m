function totalcost = totcost(gencost, Pg)
%TOTCOST    Computes total cost for generators at given output level.
%   totalcost = totcost(gencost, Pg) computes total cost for generators given
%   a matrix in gencost format and a column vector or matrix of generation
%   levels. The the return value has the same dimensions as Pg. Each row
%   of gencost is used to evaluate the cost at the points specified in the
%   corresponding row of Pg.
